         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>This paper explores the effects of climate change on agricultural practices,
             focusing on crop yields, soil health, and water resources. It highlights the challenges 
             faced by farmers and suggests sustainable practices to mitigate these impacts.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Climate change is a pressing global issue that significantly affects agriculture. 
        Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events 
        pose serious threats to food security and agricultural sustainability.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis of crop yields 
        over the past two decades with qualitative interviews from farmers across different regions.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The analysis reveals a downward trend in crop yields in regions most affected by climate change. 
        Soil degradation and water scarcity are identified as major contributing factors.</p>
